## To interact efficiently we need to take user input
## In python we take input from user by using a builtin function called "input()"
## Same as used below...

userInput = input()
print(userInput)

## We can also give placeholders in the Input same as below
userInput2 = input("How are you? ")
print(userInput2)

## Practice
user_input = input()
print(user_input)

user_input2 = input("Write your name here: ")
print("Hello,", user_input2)
